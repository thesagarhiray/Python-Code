In a project, there are 326 issues and 74 enhancements. The team size is of 9 members with following 
experience. 

TM1 - 10 years - Senior
TM2 - 9 years  - Senior
TM3 - 15 years - Senior
TM4 - 5 years  - Junior
TM5 - 2 years  - Fresher
TM6 - 3 years  - Junior
TM7 - 1 years  - Fresher
TM8 - 1 years  - Fresher
TM9 - 6 years  - Junior

The task complexities would be described as high, medium, and low. The task priorities would be described 
as high, medium, low. 

Out of 326 issues, 1 to 70 are high priority, 71 to 300 are medium priority and the remaining are low 
priority. Out of 74 enhancements, 1 to 20 are high priority, 21 to 45 are medium and the remaining are 
low priority.

Out of 326 issues, the task complexities are assumed in sequential order(high, medium, low). For ex: 
1-high, 2-medium, 3-low, 4-high,5-medium etc. Out of 74 enhancements, 1 to 44 are with medium complexity 
and remaining are low.

The project manager decides to assign high priority and high complexity tasks to Seniors. Medium priority 
and medium complexity tasks to Juniors. Low priority and low complexity to Freshers. These combinations 
could change as per demand.

Write a program 

1. To calculate the number of tasks assigned to Seniors, Juniors and Freshers. 
2. Considering the sequence to assign tasks, calculate the number of tasks assigned to each individual.
