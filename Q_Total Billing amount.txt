Estimates would be as follows 
high complexity - 5 man days
Medium complexity - 3 man days
Low complexity - 1 man day

1 man day = 8 hours.

Billing of Resource per hour
Senior - 100Rs
Junior - 50Rs
Fresher - 15Rs

A Fresher would take double the estimated time to complete the task. A Junior would take 1.5 times of 
the estimated time.

Write a program to calculate Total Billing amount.
